# Statistical Report

This is a statistical report created employing RStudio (in particular, RMarkdown).
This report contains a complete example of an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), to be more precise:
- Descriptive Analysis.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Cluster Analysis.
- Construction of a linear regression model.

(Please, note that the language used is not english, but ITALIAN because of my nationality. Forgive me.)
